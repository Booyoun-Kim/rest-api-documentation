Yudu Publisher REST API .NET Client
===================================

This is a simple .NET console application that demonstrates how to build requests and send them to our service.

Open the `DotNetYuduAPIExample` solution in Visual Studio to view and edit the code, and run or debug the application.

If debugging, remember to add a breakpoint before the end of the application to view the console window.
