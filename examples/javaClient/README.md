Yudu Publisher REST API Java Client
===================================

This is a simple java GUI application which allows you to build requests and send them to our service.

To use this application you must have the java developer kit (jdk) installed (at least version 1.6).

To run the tool from the Windows command prompt cd to this directory and run `gradlew run`

To run the tool from a Unix-like command prompt cd to this directory and run `./gradlew run`

This will compile and run the client which can then be used through the GUI. From here you can build a request and send it. The full request URI, string used to calculate the signature, calculated signature, request headers, response code, response headers and response body will be shown when the request is sent.
